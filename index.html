      I am a method developer in the Forensic Laboratory Division of the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
        My work includes developing and validating analytical methods for detecting drugs in biological matrices in forensic casework,
         resulting in being awarded the Young Scientist Meeting Award by the Society of Forensic Toxicologists.  As a hobby, I also create <a href="FunCodingProjects.html" target="_blank">games in Excel</a> using VBA, and have repositories in GitHub.

        <ul>
          <em>A method using protein precipitation followed by filtration extraction with an 8 minute run time by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed, and a comprehensive ASB/ANSI validation was performed. Target drugs and metabolites were quantitatively assessed in blood and qualitatively assessed in urine. Included were 127 target analytes including cannabinoids (12), amphetamines (11), cocaine and metabolites (6), benzodiazepines (36), Z-drugs (5), opioids (27), anticonvulsants (3), first-generation antihistamines (6), muscle relaxants (2), dissociatives and hallucinogens (6), barbiturates (10), and miscellaneous substances (3).</em>

        <li>Multi-Class Quantitation of 55 Drugs in Blood and Urine by LC-MS/MS to Complement Comprehensive DFC, DUID and Postmortem Testing</li>
        <ul>
          <em>This paper has been submitted for publication, which is pending. To aggregate drug-facilitated crime (DFC), postmortem investigations, and driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) testing, a simple method using protein precipitation followed by filtration extraction with a 5.5-minute run time by LC-MS/MS was developed, and a comprehensive ASB/ANSI validation performed. Assessed in blood quantitatively, and urine qualitatively were 55 target drug and metabolite analytes including GHB precursor (1), hallucinogens (3), muscle relaxants (3), anticonvulsants (6), antidepressants (20), antihistamines (5), antipsychotics (11), antihypertensives and alpha-adrenergics (3), and analgesics and anesthetics (3). Limits of detection are designed for maximized sensitivity in DFC, therefore are also suitable for postmortem investigations, nd other forensic casework including DUID. To demonstrate applicability, 72 proficiency test blood and urine smples, and 2,020 blood and urine samples from authentic case samples demonstrated effective detection of target nlytes in forensic casework. By increasing the analytical scope of multiple drug classes via a single method, this tcnique detects drugs that may have previously gone undetected and improves laboratory efficiency by reducing h umber of tests required. Further, when the described method is combined with a recently developed in-house mto, the combined testing scheme meets all drug requirements listed in the ASB/ANSI standards and rcmendations for DFC and postmortem testing.</em>

          <em>Project examines the role of the conceptual model for analysis of complex water management decision making. The report is divided into 4 sections. The first section provides a detailed background of the hydrogeology of the region which is a necessary first step for conceptual model development. The second section describes the various types of models that can be applied to the problem – building any one of these model types is preceded by a conceptual model. The third section builds a conceptual model using the visualization capabilities of the Aquaveo GMS software. It walks the reader through the steps suggested by Aquaveo in the development of a conceptual groundwater flow model. The last section compares the results of two models that have different underlying conceptual models. The results highlight the importance of spending time to develop a realistic initial conceptual model.</em>
