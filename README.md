- 👋 Hi, my name is Megan Farley.
- 👀 I’m interested in automating Excel using VBA to do things that Excel wouldn't normally do.  This ranges from the frivolous (making games and unusual conditional formatting in Excel) to the serious (using Excel for complex data processing and cleaning dirty data).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
